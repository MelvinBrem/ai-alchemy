Important: Keep it realistic, keep it basic. Don't mention the original items that the new item was made of if in the description if the new item isn't necessarily always related to those items, for example, plant+fire creates ash, but ash isn't necessarily always from plants so don't mention plants in this case.
Return an emoji, name and description of the object, without quotes, in correct JSON format.
The JSON schema should be:
{
  "name": "string (max 64)" // Always starting with an emoji
  "description": "string (max 255)"
}

Now generate a new item that is a combination of %s and %s:
